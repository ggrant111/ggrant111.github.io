- Multi-step lead form with validation
- Automatic email sending (no more copy/paste)
- Lead tracking and statistics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (free tier available)
- Gmail account for sending emails

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create a new table called `leads` with the following structure:

```sql
create table leads (
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid(),
  first_name text not null,
  last_name text not null,
  email text not null,
  phone text not null,
  address_street text not null,
  address_city text not null,
  address_state text not null,
  address_postal_code text not null,
  vehicle_year text,
  vehicle_make text,
  vehicle_model text,
  vehicle_vin text,
  vehicle_stock text,
  vehicle_trim text,
  vehicle_transmission text,
  comment text not null,
  destination text not null,
  sent_by text not null,
  sent_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  success boolean not null default true,
  primary key (id)
);
```

3. Get your Supabase URL and keys from the project settings page (API section)

### Salespeople Table

Create a new table named `salespeople` with the following columns:

- `id` (int8, primary key, auto-increment)
- `name` (varchar, not null)
- `created_at` (timestamp with time zone, default: now())

You can run this SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
CREATE TABLE salespeople (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create an index on the name column
CREATE INDEX idx_salespeople_name ON salespeople(name);
```

4. Set Row Level Security (RLS) policies to control access as needed.
5. Add your Supabase URL and anon key to the `.env.local` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd leadgen-next
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-public-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Email Configuration for Gmail

> **Note:** For Gmail, you need to use an App Password. See [Sign in with App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication errors with Gmail:

1. Make sure you're using an App Password, not your regular Gmail password
2. Create an App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/security
3. Select "App passwords" under the "Signing in to Google" section
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)" - you can name it "Lead Generator"
5. Copy the 16-character password (without spaces) into your .env.local file:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your16characterapppassword
   ```
6. Restart your development server

### Running the App

Make sure you're in the correct directory when running commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory first
cd leadgen-next

# Then run the development server
npm run dev

# Or build and start the production version
npm run build
npm start
```

### Linter Errors

If you encounter linter errors:

1. Run the linter to see all errors:

   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. Type checking errors can be caught with:
